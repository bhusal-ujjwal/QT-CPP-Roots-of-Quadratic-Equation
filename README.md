# QT-Roots-of-Quadratic-Equation
# Implement a cross-platform application by using Qt Widgets technology, which will be able to compute the roots of quadratic an equation.

App requirements:
Application menu: File->Quit
Ability to set A, B and C constants into the equation
The application will solve the equation and show the discriminant and roots (if they exist)
In case of non-correct input (text in number constants, discriminant lower thane 0, etc) the application will show the warning to the user.
The items "discriminant", "X1", "X2" will contain a context menu with the ability to copy the value into the clipboard.
History section in which every computation will be stored in one line and it could be hidden by using the checkbox.
